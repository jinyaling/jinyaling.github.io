## Working papers

 - **Paid Family Leave, Inventor Mobility and Firm Innovation**, with Qifei Zhu

> We exploit the adoption of US state-level Paid Family Leave (PFL) laws to test whether family-friendly policies affect firm innovation. We find that PFL policies increase the innovation outputs of firms whose employees are more exposed to these laws. The stronger attraction and the higher retention of female inventors contribute to the output gains. Tests at the state level suggest that younger inventors move into states after PFL adoption, and the move-in inventors are generally more productive than the move-out inventors at the personal level. Further tests at inventor level show that females are less likely to drop out from the inventor career after PFL adoption. Overall, the behavior change in inventor career choices is the main channel through which PFLs affect firm innovation.

>
> The paper shows that US state-level employment nondiscrimination acts (ENDAs) have a spillover effect on firms’ non-diversity corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance. We find that product market competition plays an important role in shaping the ENDA-CSR relation. The result suggests that firms proactively improve non-diversity CSR performance after ENDA enactments level the playing field of diversity. This positive effect is also more pronounced for firms with greater financial strengths, greater visibility and more socially responsible institutional investor ownership. Overall, our findings shed light on how public policies aimed at equal treatment of a particular group of employees can affect CSR policies related to other stakeholders.

> This study examines the economic consequences of China’s Three-Red-Lines policy—introduced in 2021 to cap real estate developers’ leverage by imposing strict thresholds on debt ratios and liquidity. Developers breaching these thresholds experienced sharp declines in financing, land acquisitions, and financial performance, with privately-owned developers disproportionately affected relative to state-owned firms. Using granular project-level data, we document significant
drops in sales and a demand shift from private to state-owned developers. The policy also reduced local governments’ land sale revenues, prompting greater reliance on hidden local government financing vehicles for land purchases. The policy induced broad structural changes in China’s housing and land markets.

> We use the adoption of US state-level Paid Family Leave (PFL) laws to examine the effect of family-friendly policies on firm innovation. We find that PFL policies increase the innovation outputs for firms employing workers in PFL states. We investigate three potential channels: inventor productivity, inventor mobility, and inventor career longevity. PFL policies attract female inventors from out-of-state and help firms retain their current employees. In addition, female inventors are less likely to drop out of their patenting careers after states adopt PFL policies. Overall, inventor relocation and career lengthening contribute to the innovation gains in states with PFL policies.

> The paper shows that US state-level employment nondiscrimination acts (ENDAs) have a spillover effect on firms’ non-diversity corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance. We find that product market competition plays an important role in shaping the ENDA-CSR relation. The result suggests that firms proactively improve non-diversity CSR performance after ENDA enactments level the playing field of diversity. This positive effect is also more pronounced for firms with greater financial strengths, greater visibility and more socially responsible institutional investor ownership. Overall, our findings shed light on how public policies aimed at equal treatment of a particular group of employees can affect CSR policies related to other stakeholders.
